    static let damageLocationDescription = "The location where the damage hit. If left blank, this will be random. This is only specified if the attacker aimed at a specific body location. Note that automatic fire cannot aim at a specific location.\n\nThree-round burst is random, unless it's aimed at a specific location, and in that case, only the first round hits the specified location. Please use two separate damage calculations if a three-round burst is aimed at a specific location and more than one bullet hits."
