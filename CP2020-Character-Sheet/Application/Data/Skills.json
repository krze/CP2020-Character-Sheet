This attribute represents the Cop's ability to call on the forces of the Law and Government to get what he wants. Cops can use Authority to question suspects, arrest wrongdoers, and defend innocents. Backed by the power of Authority, a cop can arrest, detain, confiscate and enter nearly anywhere, as long as he has the proper arrest or search warrants to back his play. However, authority is only as good as the guy holding the badge - if the cop appears uncertain of his Authority, there's a good chance he'll get nailed by the people he's trying to confront. The higher your Authority, the more able you are to face down criminals, particularly high level mobsters and officials. Authority is applied to your Cool stat.",

This ability (added to your Cool stat) allows the Rockerboy to control, incite and charm large number of people through his or her performance skills. When under the Rocker's control, this group can easily be persuaded to act on his suggestions; for example, a Rocker could convince a concert crowd to riot in the streets or attack a heavily fortified police line. Charismatic Leadership will only work with groups of ten or more people as it is primarily a mob leadership ability. The higher your Charismatic Leadership, the larger a crowd you can control and the more direct and complex the instructions you can get them to follow. For example, a level +3 Leadership could incite a nightclub crowd to get rowdy. A level +5 or +6 could provoke a concert crowd of thousands to trash a neighborhood, if the area wasn't too far from the hall. At level +9, and higher, you have the same sort of mesmeric ability as an Adolph Hitler - you can raise armies, start movements, and destroy nations.",

With a level +3 Credibility, you can convince most people of minor scandals.
